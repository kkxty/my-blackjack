some experiments on blackjack strategies

I make the following assumptions with my simulations:  
• One player and one dealer are in the game  
• One deck of 52 cards are used  
• After each game, the deck is reset and shuffled  
• The dealer keeps hitting until a soft 17  
• The initial bet is 1 dollar, and player can double down at most once  
• Each strategy is played with 10000 games to calculate the total profit for  
comparisons

The following 3 sets of experiments are run:  
• Soft threshold : similar to how dealer stops at a soft 17, I experiment with  
player stopping at different soft thresholds  
• Hard threshold : while guaranteeing not to risk exploding, also set a hard  
threshold above which the player will stop drawing  
• Double Down : if the player has a good hand value, double the bets for  
more potential profit
